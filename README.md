RSS fetcher for www.emocore.se
======
Save _certs.pem_ and _v2ecfetch.php_ to a new page on your webserver, insert your username and password into the _v2ecfetch.php_ and then link your rss reader to that file. It will then fetch the data everytime it tries to access the link.

Optional: Format the output to look a little bit nicer in $rssfeed
